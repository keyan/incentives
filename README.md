# incentives

LaTeX files for a game theory/economics course I took at UW.

For the project component of the course I wrote a theoretical analysis of physician payment systems and proposed a new reputation based payment model.

This paper can be found: [here](https://github.com/keyan/incentives/blob/master/final.pdf)

There is also a small simulation program written to partially validate some of the ideas. It doesn't do anything too interesting, but can be run with:

```
python3 provider_trust_network.py
```
