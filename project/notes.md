1 - Lessons from Game Theory about Healthcare System Price Inflation
====================================================================
https://link-springer-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/content/pdf/10.1007/s40258-012-0003-z.pdf

- case study on reducing costs to patients and insurers by modifying fee-for-service pricing with an alternative framework
- alternative pricing framework relies on providers managing outpatient claims, insruer manging inpatient claims, and tiing insurance premiums to patients healthy bevahiors
- doctors chosing prices influences demand experienced by hospitals (and reverse)
- easing price distoration can be done parly by cooperative contracual pricing arrangements

- Use of a blended model where outpatient services are using capitation and inpatient is billed to insurance
	- this avoids "fee-for-service" problem of no concern for cost
	- but also avoids capitation problem of less concern for patient outcome, giving good service prevents longer term serious issues that would cost the provider more in outpatient costs
	- also avoid shifting all the risk on providers by billing inpatient to insurance

2 - Prisoners dilemma and doctor prescribing

"""
The doctor-patient interaction is a complicated game but one that can be improved using the tools of game theory. The Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma is a good starting point to see how interests of patients and doctors cannot reach an optimal outcome because of competing individual interests. Whatever health care reforms are made should at minimum address these concerns.

3 - Game theory and strategy in medical training
====================================================================
- not relevant to my topic, focused on residents


4 - Aligning provider incentives to improve primary healthcare delivery in the United States
====================================================================
Describes the two main payment structures, fee-for-service and capitation model, discusses prisoners dilemma analogies and equilibrium for each. Then presents an alternative model called "blended payments" which escapes some of these issues by merging both models with payments for externalities and benchmarks.

5 - Aligning Incentives in Health Care: A Multiscale Decision Theory Approach
====================================================================
- presents the MSDT approach and applies it to analysis of Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)
- Introduced as part of the ACA, it gives Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) finanicla incentives for cost reduction and meeting quality standards
- ACOs are groups of providers/hospitals that continue to bill using FFS (fee-for-service), but get 50%+ of cost savings if the ACO as a whole meets a quality benchmark and cost limit
- ACO incentive distribution is unsolved and not defined gov't

a. What is the effect of ACO incentives on decisions/outomes?
b. how to optimally distribute incentives in ACO?


6 - Modern health care as a game theory problem
====================================================================
- Framing opoid Rx as prisioners dilemma
- focus on formalizing provider decisions based solely on outcomes and doctor not being sued/etc. Financial incentives are not discussed at all
- discussions around role of trust in the decision making process
- formal computations for mixed strategy Nash eq. for extensive form game for treatment decisions

7 - Models of the medical consultation: opportunities and limitations of a game theory perspective
